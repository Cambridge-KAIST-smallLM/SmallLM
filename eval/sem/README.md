# Semantic Evaluation 

Semantic Similarity is defined in various standard evaluation metrics: 

- SimLex999: nouns, verbs, adjectives
- SimVerb3500 (lots of verbs)
- MEN
- Card600

These define word pairs grouped based on semantic similarity with a gold correlation score based on human annotators. 

These tests in combination provide a holistic measure of model preference for semantic and conditional similarity. 

The most important evaluation is Card600 (rare word similarity). 

Conditional Similarity (frequency contingent):
